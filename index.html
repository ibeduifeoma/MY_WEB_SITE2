        <h1>THIS IS MY RELATIONSHIP COUNSELLING  NETBOOM</h1>
        <h2>THIS IS THE BEGINING OF THE WRITE UP</h2>
        <p>This netboom is essencially for relationship, not necessarily a sexual relationship </p>
        <p> Imagine a world without relationship.
            According to Stephen Covey, author of ‘The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People’, the reason why most relationships fail is because we focus on changing our superficial behaviors and attitudes before addressing the way we perceive the relationship itself.
